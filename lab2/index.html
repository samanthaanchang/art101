			<h1>Hello World ૮ ˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶ ა</h1>


			<p>My partner and I are so swag! My name is Sammy, and my partner is Kristine. We both enjoy doing digital art.</p>



			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>🔎 Challenge</h2>
					<p>Let's take the chance to get to know HTML and CSS! Take a look around the template for ART101, and familiarize yourself!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>📌 Problems</h2>
					<p>In my process, I found understanding the difference between lab.css and site.css to be hard at first. After rereading Wes' notes and going over it, I was able to learn more and broaden my understanding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>💭 Reflection</h2>
					<p>After getting to know VSC, I think the process was interesting. I had to really poke around and play with the tools given, make myself familiar, and then I could do all sorts of "magic"!</p>
			</div>
